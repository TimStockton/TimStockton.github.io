                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy web development, machine learning, software engineering, data analysis, and all things music. I'm passionate about the internet and understanding complex systems, and I love to create. When I'm not programming, I like to produce electronic bass music, DJ, make 3D animations, play video games, hike, lift weights, and write blog posts.</p>
                    <p>My programming journey began in 2019 learning the basics with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/electronictech55" target="blank">Free Code Camp</a> where I completed three certifications: Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures, and Front End Development Libraries. Some of the projects on this site were made as part of the certificate curriculum.</p>
                    <p>Now I have a bachelors degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.keene.edu/" target="blank">Keene State College</a> (graduated in 2023 with double honors, Computer Science major and Mathematics minor). The first full-stack application I worked on was a college research project called Owl Assist Information System (OAIS). I was one of the first 3 student devs, and I assisted in it's construction and was tasked with maintaining it. It is a Flask application that utilizes web scrapers, Dialog Flow, Google Cloud, AWS, Selenium, and more. This project was my first real exposure to Git and Github as well as Trello. There were a couple articles written about OAIS. The first was in <a href="https://kscequinox.com/2021/04/say-hi-to-the-new-owl-assist/">The Equinox: April 14, 2021</a>, and the second was in <a href="https://www.keene.edu/news/stories/detail/students-create-owl-assist-chatbot-using-artificial-intelligence/">KSC Stories: April 16, 2021</a>. There was also an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgMXuNEhgD0">Equinox Video Interview: April 29, 2021</a>.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am working on personal projects and challenges to learn more and keep my skills sharp.</p>

                        <p>Music is what keeps me going, life would be so dull without it. I have been producing since 2013, and love being able to artistically express myself. I have made several artist portfolio websites, the most recent being for my main alias, <a href="https://psidemica.com">Psidemica</a>. This site in particular has been under construction since the end of 2023. I started with a textbook example of a PHP application, and modified it beyond recognition. I built and customized an e-commerce shop as well as a members activity hub. This website is the most feature-rich project I have made myself from start to finish. I have also used Python to build automated tests.</p>

                        <p>From 2021 to 2023 I self-hosted an older artist portfolio site on my personal home server via Apache. I have since changed names in order to secure trademarks, so this became more of an archival site before being taken down entirely (I will eventually add these older songs etc to a secret archive page on the Psidemica website).</p>
